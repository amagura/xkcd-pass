# xkcd-pass
A password generator based on the XKCD comic


# Updates
I recently tried using https://www.xkpasswd.net/ since this project is pretty bare bones and more a technical demo, but given how horrifically insecure the passwords that website generates
I've decided to uptake work on this once more.  The world needs _more_ secure password generators and less trash like https://www.xkpasswd.net/

Some example passwords from https://www.xkpasswd.net/:

MercuryJapanVenusGalaxyDriveMetal
FastHelloPlaneDailyPresentVisit
FingerDrinkWellSuddenRhythmSilent
WindowPositionTeachRoseCoursePushed

Notice anything funny?  That's right!  All of them have words which are related to each other in English, which is a big no-no for XKCD passwords and is something _actually_ mentioned in the relevant comic.  

I've created a ticket for that project and hopefully they'll introduce a patch to fix this, but in the meantime...
